# LUCETTE

lucette is a daemon that runs on Raspberry PI, listen to some music that gets
in through the line in of an USB sound card, do some FFT magic and pilot an
Unicorn HAT leds matrix according to the music beat/tempo whatever.

This is WIP, the code is a mess, and I don't really know why it works.
